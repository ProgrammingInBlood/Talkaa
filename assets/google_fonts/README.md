Place Roboto font files downloaded from https://fonts.google.com in this directory.

Required weights (matching current theme):
- Roboto-Regular.ttf (w400)
- Roboto-Medium.ttf (w500)
- Roboto-Bold.ttf (w700)

Important:
- Do NOT rename the files. The google_fonts package expects canonical filenames.
- If you add italics, include the Italic variants (e.g., Roboto-Italic.ttf).
- After adding files, run `flutter pub get` and restart the dev server.
